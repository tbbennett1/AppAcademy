# Video Code Demos

For the video code demos, the idea is that the demo is broken up into 
sections, the students watch each section at the same time, and after 
each section, we have a live Q/A with them. We also have the code that 
was written during the video to have pulled up during the Q/A. We can 
edit the code and demo things as part of answering the questions.

In order to prep for the live Q/A, all we need to do is to watch the demo 
video at the same time as the students and then just have the demo code 
pulled up.

Instructions for the students should be that they watch the video and 
write down any questions they have as they're watching to ask during 
the Q/A. Writing down file and line numbers to make it easier to pull 
up the relevant portions during Q/A.

The password for all the videos is go_video_go. Do give the students 20% 
extra time to watch each video so that they can pause it to write down
questions or rewind and re-watch portions if needed.

See in each day's directory for the code and links to the videos for that day.

NB: Some of the sections don't have videos. This is only for solutions to 
the previous day's projects that students often don't get to. For these, 
we have the code here, so just check whether a significant number of the
students got to it and do a Q/A walkthrough of the solutions. The project
should be familiar from the previous day so shouldn't really need any prep 
for this.
