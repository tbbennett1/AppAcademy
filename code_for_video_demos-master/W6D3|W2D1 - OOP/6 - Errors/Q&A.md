1. Lots of questions about how `MyCustomError => e` works - explain how, just like we use hash rocket to associate key-value pairs, we are associating the variable `e` with the error instance so that we have access to its methods
2. Demonstrate how you can rescue multiple errors in a begin/rescue block
3. How do students know which errors to inherit from when writing their own custom error?
